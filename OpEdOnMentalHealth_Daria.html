            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Daria Chen and I am the Community Advisor here at Bay
              Area Youth for Justice. In a time like today with the
              ever lurking COVID pandemic and the rising discussions about racial injustices, it is easy to get
              overwhelmed. Not being
              able to see your friends, go on vacation, and having evidence of the daily trauma that POC’s receive
              because of their
              skin color all can make us go pretty crazy. That’s why here at BAYFJ, we wanted to dedicate our first
              segment to the
              importance of mental health.</p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up, I have always been a silent sufferer. If something
              bothered me, I would ponder it by myself but never say a
              word about it to others. It never occurred to me that this was a bad thing. All the adults in my life at
              the time
              praised me for how grown up I was at such a young age, and always described me as being so mature for my
              age because of
              this. Even today, this is my downfall. On March 26th of 2019 I was diagnosed with depression, social
              anxiety, general
              anxiety, and a panic disorder. I would be started on daily medications and weekly meetings with a
              psychologist. </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the few months leading up to my diagnosis, it became harder
              and harder to conceal how badly I was doing. I began
              having panic attacks during French class, after piano classes, and even when I was just thinking about the
              future. I
              would sleep for the whole evening after school just to escape and then stay up to ungodly hours to finish
              my homework.
              It was a cycle of pain and numbness that I didn’t know how to stop. During my annual physical that year, I
              tried to
              describe what I was feeling to my pediatrician. She brushed it off because I was sitting there, smiling
              and looking
              happy, so that obviously meant that I was fine. I found that many of the adults that I confided in shared
              similar ideas,
              that looking happy and not speaking your truth meant happiness. This is not the case. Everyone has a
              different
              definition of happiness, but over the years I have found that being genuine with yourself and others is
              what makes the
              difference when it comes to being happy. Ever since I have started feeling more and more like myself, I
              have made it my
              mission to be that unbiased, non judgemental person that I wish I had had in my time of need.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not meant to be a sob story in any way shape or form. In
              order to combat the stigma around mental health, there
              needs to be more open discussions about its importance and about each other’s stories so that we can learn
              from each
              other.

            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our thoughts are like a massive knot of threads. The more we think
              about them, the more confusing and tangled they can
              become. By having resources and people to talk to, the knot becomes smaller and less of a burden. Everyone
              deserves
              the
              right to be happy, and even if you don’t think that you do, you can’t truly be there for others until you
              are there
              for
              yourself.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started Bay Area Youth For Justice because I wanted to create a
              space for teenagers to talk. Talk about what they care
              about, what worries them, what they celebrate, what issues really hit home. Because we can’t change the
              world if we
              don’t talk about what needs to be changed. Conversation is the first step towards making real progress--in
              order to move
              forward, we need to be united and understand each other’ s needs and views. And in order to be united and
              understand
              each other, we need to listen and talk to each other. We need to be heard and make other people feel
              heard. That’s when
              we can move forward as a society. Bay Area Youth For Justice is a place where teenagers and youth can be
              heard and feel
              like their views matter. It’s about listening, learning, talking, and growing together to create a more
              accepting and
              open-minded society.</p>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The death of George Floyd was a tipping point for millions of people
              around the world. The world was tired of seeing
              injustice on top of injustice against black lives. In spite of COVID-19 thousands of people marched
              peacefully to get
              justice and spread awareness for all the black lives lost to police brutality. Social media was blowing up
              with people
              reposting instances of injustice to bring awareness and many different petitions were created to put
              pressure on the
              federal and national government. As a teengager myself, I was constantly on social media looking into the
              posts that
              many people reposted. I soon realized that a lot of the information we were getting was either false or
              only showed one
              side of the story. In order to bring justice to these situations we have to look at both sides and we have
              to dig deep
              and gather all the evidence we can. As I saw all of this unravelling around me, I realized that I wanted
              to do something
              more and I wanted to unite the youth in the Bay Area for something bigger. This is why I created Bay Area
              Youth For
              Justice. To give the youth a platform to speak out against the injustices they see in our world today
              whether it be
              through artwork, research papers, or group discussions. We are currently planning many zoom panels in
              which activists
              for specific movements can speak to our members about how to help this movement while also educating us
              about the
              movement. Bay Area Youth For Justice is a student led nonprofit committed to creating a safe environment
              for people to
              get educated and educate others.
